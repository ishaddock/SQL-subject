Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.

first way:
select name,x.continent,population
from world x
left join (select continent,max(population) as mp
from world
group by continent) as y
on x.continent=y.continent
where y.mp<=25000000;


second way:
select x.name,x.continent,x.population from world x
where 25000000 >= all(select y.population from world y where x.continent = y.continent);
