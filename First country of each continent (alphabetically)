first way:
SELECT x.continent, x.name 
FROM world as x
WHERE x.name<=ALL
    (SELECT y.name 
    FROM world as y 
    WHERE y.continent=x.continent);
         
second way:
SELECT continent,NAME FROM world X 
WHERE NAME = (SELECT y.name FROM world Y WHERE x.continent = y.continent ORDER BY NAME LIMIT 1);
